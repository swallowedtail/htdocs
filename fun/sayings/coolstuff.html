				<li>Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I may not follow. Do not walk beside me for the path is narrow. In fact, just piss off and leave me alone.</li>
				<li>Sex is like air. It's not important unless you aren't getting any.</li>
				<li>No one is listening until you fart.</li>
				<li>Always remember you're unique. Just like everyone else.</li>
				<li>Never test the depth of the water with both feet.</li>
				<li>If you think nobody cares whether you're alive or dead, try missing a couple of mortgage payments.</li>
				<li>Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way, when you criticize them, you're a mile away and you have their shoes.</li>
				<li>If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you.</li>
				<li>Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach him how to fish, and he will sit in a boat and drink beer all day.</li>
				<li>If you lend someone £20 and never see that person again, it was probably well worth it.</li>
				<li>If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.</li>
				<li>Some days you are the bug; some days you are the wind screen.</li>
				<li>Don't worry; it only seems kinky the first time.</li>
				<li>Good judgment comes from bad experience, and most of that comes from bad judgment.</li>
				<li>A closed mouth gathers no foot.</li>
				<li>There are two theories to arguing with women. Neither one works.</li>
				<li>Generally speaking, you aren't learning much when your lips are  moving.</li>
				<li>Experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.</li>
				<li>We are born naked, wet and hungry, and get slapped on our bum ... then things just get worse.</li>
				<li>Never, under any circumstances, take a sleeping pill and a laxative on the same night.</li>

				<li>Just before the funeral services, the undertaker came up to the very elderly widow and asked,<br>
				'How old was your husband?' '98,' she replied.<br>
				'Two years older than me'<br>
				'So you're 96,' the undertaker commented.<br>
				She responded, 'Hardly worth going home, is it?</li>
				<li>Reporters interviewing a 104-year-old woman:<br>
				'And what do you think is the best thing about being 104?' the reporter asked.<br>
				She simply replied, 'No peer pressure.'</li>
				<li>The nice thing about being senile is<br>
				You can hide your own Easter eggs.</li>
				<li>I've sure gotten old!<br>
				I've had two bypass surgeries, a hip replacement,<br>
				New knees, fought prostate cancer and diabetes<br>
				I'm half blind,<br>
				Can't hear anything quieter than a jet engine,<br>
				Take 40 different medications that<br>
				Make me dizzy, winded, and subject to blackouts.<br>
				Have bouts with dementia ...<br>
				Have poor circulation;<br>
				Hardly feel my hands and feet any more.<br>
				Can't remember if I'm 85 or 92.<br>
				Have lost all my friends.<br>
				But, thank God,<br>
				I still have my driver's licence.</li>
				<li>My memory's not as sharp as it used to be.<br>
				Also, my memory's not as sharp as it used to be.</li>
				<li>Know how to prevent sagging?<br>
				Just eat till the wrinkles fill out.</li>
				<li>It's scary when you start making the same noises<br>
				As your coffee maker.</li>
				<li>These days about half the stuff in my shopping cart says,<br>
				' For fast relief.'</li>
				<li>THE SENILITY PRAYER:<br>
				Grant me the senility to forget the people<br>
				I never liked anyway,<br>
				The good fortune to run into the ones I do, and<br>
				The eyesight to tell the difference.</li>
