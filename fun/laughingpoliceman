I notice a policeman 
He's always on our street 
A fat and jolly red-faced man 
He really is a treat 

He's too kind for a policeman 
He's never known to frown 
And everybody says 
He is the happiest man in town! 

He laughs while he's on duty 
He laughs while on his beat 
He laughs at everybody 
When he's walking down the street 

He never can stop laughing 
He says he's never tried 
But once he did arrest a man 
And laughed until he cried! 

His jolly face is wrinkled 
And then he shut his eyes 
He opened up his great big mouth 
It was a wonderous size! 

He said: "I must arrest you!" 
He didn't know what for 
And then he started laughing 
Until he cracked his jaw! 

Now if you chance to meet him 
While walking 'round the town 
Shake him by his fat ol' hand 
And give him half a crown 

His eyes will glint and sparkle 
He'll gurgle with delight 
And then you'll start him laughing 
With all his girth and might!
